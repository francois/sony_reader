This is a proof-of-concept attempt working with Sony's PRS-T1 eReader database. This gem provides the lower-level layer: the plumbing on which other tools can be built.

Example
-------

Ensure you have ImageMagick's `convert` tool available on the path, and have installed this gem, then:

from the command line
=====================

    $ sreader PATH_TO_READER add --title="Book's Title" --author="Book's Author" --epub="path/to/epub" --cover="path/to-cover"


from Ruby (IRB works just fine)
===============================

    require "sony_reader"

    db = SonyReader::Database.new("/Volumes/READER", "/Volumes/READER/Sony_Reader/database/books.db")
    db.add_book("Book's Title", "Book's Author", "PATH/TO/EPUB", "PATH/TO/COVER")

Why?
----

When I attempted to install the Sony Reader software, it wanted to reboot my machine. I chose not to install the software and roll my own solution, especially after I noticed the use of SQLite as the database format.
